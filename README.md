# aws-incident-response-bootstrap
AWS CDK managed infrastructure to kickstart an incident response practice.

## How to Use

Included in this repository are a number of infrastructure starting points for building an incident response program in AWS. These starting points are broken down by level of complexity starting with Level 0 (no infrastructure) and going to Level 100 (comprehensive infrastructure). 

Each level will be found in a corresponding branch with the `main` branch incorporating the most complicated infrastructure, i.e. to see the level 40 infrastructure change branch to `level40`.

## Level 0

No incident response infrastructure.

Congrats, you already have this deployed in your AWS account. In fact, you already have a very sophisticated CI/CD deployment of this in your account on behalf of the fine folks at AWS. AWS will email your root email address if it detects any particularly malicious behavior happening in your account, hope you're checking that email!
